# Project-2D
My project 2D is focus on which species are dugong related to, is it elephant, whale, or dolphin? Dugong is mammal hence in general we would think that it is more related to mammals that live in the water, but my results shows that it is more related to hyrax after checking the similarity of mitochondrion genome.
